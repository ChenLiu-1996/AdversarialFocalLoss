# Adversarial Focal Loss: <br>Asking Your Discriminator for Hard Examples
We proposed a generalizable adaptation of Focal Loss to keypoint detection leveraging difficulty scores from a discriminator.

Sorry for not being able to provide the code. The team and I conducted this research project while I was working full-time at GE Healthcare, and by the time I organized this repository I had already left the company for PhD.
